A python program that calculates the times of festivals and the beginning and ending of the fasting days.

Bahire Hasab - ባሕረ ሃሳብ (The Sea of Ideas), also known as Abushakir is a chronological system used for calculating the times of festivals and the beginning and ending of the fasting days throughout the year.

The Ge’ez Calendar has much in common with the Coptic-Egyptian Calendar but not identical. The two calendars differ with regards to the time and observation of Saints' days. Pope Demetrios of the Church of Alexandria(seat of St. Mark) utilized Mitonic cycles. The calculations of Claudius Ptolemy and the Egyptian calendar were to establish the rules for calculating Easter on the day of a particular New Year.

According to the beliefs of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahdo Church, God created the world 5500 years before the birth of Our Lord and Savior Eyesus Kristos and it is 2016 years since Our Lord and Savior Eyesus Kristos was born. Based on this timeline, we are in the year 7515 (5500 + 2015) of the eighth millennium. These are referred to as Amete Alem or “The Years from the Beginning of Creation”.


The Ethiopic years have four year cycles. The years are named after the Evangelists Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. Each year has four seasons, autumn(fall), winter, spring and summer. A week has seven days. Each day has a numeric value for use in its calendrical calculations. Apart from hours, minutes and seconds the Ethiopic calendar also has a time frame known as Kekros(ኬክሮስ). A Kekros is 1/60th of a day. A solar year has 365 days and 15 Kekroses while a lunar year has 364 days and 22 Kekroses. 

Enoch wrote his Ethiopic Bible as the first and oldest author in any human language. The Book of Enoch has been part of the Ethiopian Canon. 

"_The year is exactly as to its days three hundred and sixty-four._"
                                    ~**Book of Enoch 72:33**
